The user will get the full experience of buying and selling stock on the web without having to invest actual currency. 
The program is accessed through a web browser. To use the simulator users visit the web-page and must register with a username, email and password. Once registered the user will have a set sum of virtual currency added to a virtual bank account. This money can then be used to virtually invest in real stocks in the stock market.
The program will have a searchable database of traded companies that can be used to find companies in which the user would like to invest. The companies can be searched by name, type of company (i.e. tech, retail, manufacturing), or by stock symbol. The program will have access to actual current stock data for pricing of shares. Once a company is selected the user will be able to view graphs of the companyâ€™s stock history as well as any relevant recent news about the company. The graphs will be viewable in one day, one week, one month, three month, six month, one year, and two year displays. This information can then be used to decide if stocks will be purchased. When stocks are purchased the money is deducted from the users virtual bank account and the shares are added to their virtual portfolio.
